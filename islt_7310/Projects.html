   <div class="Project1"><h3>Summer Animation</h3><p>
        This was one of my first animations before taking any animation
        class. I wanted something with a cat and frog. For the
        background I knew I wanted more of a forest floor feel, so I
        studied the floors of grassy forest areas for a few days. I’m so
        proud of this piece, but looking back on it, I would have done so
        many things differently that would have saved me time. It’s just
        the lack of knowing that makes me laugh at the little mistakes.

        <h3>Cat Attacking Butterfly</h3>
        <p>
        This was my first animation in animation class. We did hand drawn
        animation first because my professor thought it would be a nice
        introduction. I wanted to make it about a fluffy black cat doing cat
        things. I chose a butterfly also because it would have the action I
        needed, and it wouldn’t just be empty space for three seconds. I
        wanted the butterfly to stand out, so I did orange. My reasoning
        was, the grass is green, the sky is blue, and the cat is black. Since
        the opposite of blue is orange, and the opposite of green is red,
        during a deep orange was perfect. For the cat, I was satisfied with
        just doing scribbles, since sometimes cats are just chaotic balls of
        chaos with whatever is closest to them

       <h3> Dinosaur Animation</h3> <p>
    This is a wacky animation I made. It was initially an exercise
    animation for my class, but I like it a lot to just be its own
    thing. The original exercise was supposed to be a
    metamorphic loop, where you turn one object into two other
    things, then back to its original form. My favorite part of this
    animation is when the dinosaur becomes balloon like and
    zooms everywhere. The one thing I would change about this,
    is when the dinosaur poofs up, and his eyes widen, I would
    make it more cartoony, and let his eyes fluctuate back and
    forth. Like when an actual ballon is trying to find a place to
    put the extra air/ tension.
