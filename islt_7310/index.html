    <p>My purpose of this website is to record my progress throughout the projects I do. Here you can find my work in progress, animation
        practices, and finished projects. I am hoping that having this collective archive will also show me more
        progress versus what feels like is progress. It would awesome also if having this website will land me a
        future job film or animation. I worked so hard on these projects, and Iâ€™m looking forward to
        work on more in the future. Thank you so much for your time and I hope you enjoy it!
