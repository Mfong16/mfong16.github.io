   <span style="font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;">E</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ver since I was seven, I knew I wanted to be an artist.</span> However I asked my mom, and she said no, they don’t make enough. So,
for a long seven years, I never really picked up a pencil to draw seriously. I focused more on other things, like what will make
more money, and what will make my parents happy. What would do both of those things is being A+ student who just so
happened to want to be an engineer. It’s not that I didn’t like engineering, I lstoved it. Loving engineering is why I thought I
would do it for the rest of my life. I love pulling something apart, and seeing how it works, then reassembling or improving it. I
thought I was going to be a programming or mechanical engineer. I love programming and getting a feel of making something
do something, with the power of organization, science and math. Overall, I love knowing why something works. Another reason
why I was planning to do engineering all my life is
because a teacher in 8th grade said that that isn’t what I’ll probably do though because people change their mind throughout
high school, and I wanted to prove her wrong. Turns out she was right.
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I honestly blame origami, and YouTube.</span> I was always good at origami. If I knew what I knew now, I would have sold them or
have people pay me to teach them because that’s how impressed people were. I eventually started thinking that maybe prop
design is for me. I like working with my hands and making thing. That thought always sat at the back of my mind for the longest
time. The reason why I blame YouTube is because I remember watching hours and hours of beautiful animations in middle
school. I wanted to do exactly what they were during, so I started drawing again. My mom was not happy, so I reassured her
that I was going to become an engineer.
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">During Covid, that is when I really wanted to go into the film and animation field. I wanted to be part of projects that helped
    people escape for a bit or feel something.</span> I remember watching behind the scenes videos of films and tv shows and wanting
more than ever to be a part of those kind of projects. I didn’t care which job, as long as I was in film and animation. I was more
than ever memorized by how people can tell a story through the choices they made. Rather it be through colors, and scenery,
or a simple sound or dialogue. Obviously, I wanted to be happy, and have a sustainable life, but that was basically the end of
my engineering dreams. Each year it gets better and better because I learn new things and I’m closer to my goal.
