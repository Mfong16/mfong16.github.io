            I am currently pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in film production at the University of Missouri.
            While attending, I learned many new skills, such as editing, lighting, and cinematography.
            My future career goal is to have a job in either animation or film. I want to try everything at
            least once, so I can learn and grow from those experiences. The most important thing
            though is to live a comfortable life where I am happy and feel fulfilled.
        <br><br>
            Something I like to do in my free time is swimming. I love to improve my swimming skills
            and try to be as fast as possible in the water. Another thing I like to do is make clothes. I
            usually make skirts and dresses with cute patterns.
        <br><br>
            A few personal goals for me is, to travel more with friends in the next ten years, improve my
            baking and dessert skills, and finally get good at drawing hyper-realistic pictures of people.
